RANDOM_FILES
============

Here is a place to store random files that you need to access from places you can't just copy the files. 

This repo is PUBLIC and can be downloaded by anyone on the internet. I recomend that you encrypt the files ou put here with something. (Symantic encription would be fine)

I (Joshua Gudmundson), the mantainer of this repo, am not responcibal for any data lost or stolen as a resualt of beening placed here. Use at your own risk.
